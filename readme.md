# tomorepo
We all build a ton of websites using VueJS, but we often find that a component we build in one project can be used in another.

The purpose of this repository is to collect the best individual components so that they can be written once and imported wherever they may be wanted.

We also use `collections` to group together components which are related and may want to be imported together.

This repository is a work in progress (July 2020)

## What is tomorepo?
A mono repository of useful VueJS based components. We build a ton of websites using VueJS and often find that a component in one project can be used in another.

The purpose of this repository is to collect the best individual components so that they can be written once and imported wherever they may be wanted.

We also use `collections` to group together components which are related and may want to be imported together.

Feel free to add your own components or extend ours by submitting a PR
